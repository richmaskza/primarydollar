P2P PoA Blockchain 
##Hello

I have created this project to create a simple blockchain that kids can interact with and to learn about money, blockchain technology and trust.

PrimaryDollar is an Android/IOS “app” that functions as both a proof-of-authority (PoA) blockchain node and wallet. 

Main purpose of app is to give kids their first bulk money, to teach them, either at home or in the classroom blockchain, while learning some great money investment lessons eg https://www.moneyprodigy.com/games-to-play-with-fake-money/replace , https://www.ehow.com/list_7178837_money-games-play-party.html

Kids/parents/teachers with a PrimaryDollar wallet/node will be able to receive or send coins for free once coins are loaded into their dedicated wallet. Using the PoA blockchain validation process removes the restriction of gas fees allowing anyone to participate in the blockchain technology space


How app will work
* app connects to the PrimaryDollar  PoA blockchain network 
* Node only starts processing transactions when user opens the app “connects” 
* When app is closed “disconnected”, the node stops running
* User has to connect node to network to view their balance and send and receive coins (This allows for faster and free transactions, as the node reaches consensus with other nodes on the network more quickly) 
* Coin name : PrimaryDollar
* The more transactions the node verifies the higher trustworthy rating node receives 
* the disconnection function makes the app non resource-intensive unlike running a traditional, centralised application. This is because the node does not continuously process and validate transactions, which can require significant computing power and storage. As a result, any entry level  Android device with a decent processor and dedicated memory  can run a PoA node effectively)
* two-factor authentication, biometric scans or hardware security keys, can be used to protect the node and wallet.
* Organizations / parents / kids / anyone can get token through direct transfers, reward programs and bulk tokens for projects through in-app faucet and use credit card to buy coins
* Trust Solution POA does not need gas fees since a consensus is reached through POA

Im not a professional developer but would love to do this for children , small communities and informal traders.

*** the app can also act as a basic contract for informal traders where the PrimaryDollar is used to represent a physical item eg value of stock loaned  and proof of transaction
